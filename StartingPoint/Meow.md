## Introduction 

when first starting a pen test or any security evaluation, a primary step is enumeration   
enumeration consists of documenting the current state of a target to learn as much as possible about it 

every server uses ports to serve data to other clients   
the first step of enumeration is to scan these ports to see the purpose of the target and what potential vulnerabilities might appear from the services running on it 

`nmap` is a tool that lets us quickly scan for ports 

after finding all the open ports on a target we can manually access each of them using different tools   
90% of pen testing consists of research done about the product you are testing   

key objective is not speed but meticulousness  
if a resource is missed during enumeration then you might lose a vital attack vector
